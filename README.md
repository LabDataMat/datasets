# Dataset Description
The Soybean Nutrient Deficiency (SND) dataset was established by acquiring hyperspectral data at the soybean seedling stage (wavelength range: 400–1000 nm) over a 4-mu (0.267-hectare) experimental field in Xilinzi Village, Shuangfeng Sub-district, Acheng District, Harbin City, Heilongjiang Province, China. The data was collected using a DJI M350 RTK unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) equipped with a VNIR series HSP0410 gimbal-mounted hyperspectral camera at 60 meters altitude. Subsequently, ENVI software was utilized for atmospheric correction and annotation of the raw data, generating usable data with a spatial resolution of 2787 × 807 pixels and 260 spectral bands. It comprises 7 land-cover classes and 1,183,951 labeled samples, this dataset is primarily dedicated to detecting the spatial distribution of soybean nutrient deficiency-affected regions.
